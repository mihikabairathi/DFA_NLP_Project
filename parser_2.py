construct a history. Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth 
Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralized 
at Memphis. While the Old Kingdom was a period of internal security and 
prosperity, it was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural 
decline referred to by Egyptologists as the First Intermediate Period. During 
the Old Kingdom, the king of Egypt (not called the Pharaoh until the New
